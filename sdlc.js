// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning



// 1- Planning
// 2- Analysis of Requirements
// 3- Design
// 4- Implementation
// 5- Testing & Integration
// 6- Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "step 2: Determine the feasibility of the project: estimate the cost and resources required for implementing the analyzed requirements with details the risks involved and provides sub-plans for softening those risks."
const design = "Step 3: Design Specification will be created (by the team); reviewed (by client) & suggested (between the team and client)"
const implementation = "Step 4: Build: with blueprint & guidelines (code style and practices)"
const testingAndIntegration = "Step 5: Test run the application to discover and fix any defects and deficiencies until theose issues are resolved and the product still meets the original specifications and Staging: either prototype or actual product to be used or implemented and this step can be different depending on the company decision maker"
const maintain = "Step 6: Monitoring closely of the application performance to ensure any post implementation maintenance and support are availabe"
